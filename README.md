The 21st century Rolodex: The ultimate address book
  In the days before cell phones and digital telephones, being a social butterfly required much more effort and time than it does now. This is mainly since the only way to keep track of names, birthdays, and phone numbers was to either write them down or risk forgetting them, thereby potentially ruining relationships with friends and acquaintances.
  
  One somewhat practical way to keep track of so many names, numbers, and addresses in the past was to use a prehistoric device known as a Rolodex. This was basically an address book on steroids as it even had its own set of non-functional wheels. The Rolodex was especially enticing to businesses because it could sit on a receptionist’s desk and allow the receptionist to keep track of different clients’ names through an alphabetically categorized approach that could even go as far as to become color-coded. The Rolodex amassed huge popularity, particularly in the United States, but there was always the question of whether there was a more practical solution.
 
	This was, of course, until the invention of the personal digital assistant (PDA), smartphones, and the internet in the late 90s and the beginning of the 21st century that bulky, inconvenient paperweights like phonebooks and address books were no longer necessary. Technology has brought us several luxuries in day-to-day life, but the elimination of a need to physically write everything down has certainly been one of the greatest benefits of having that technology.
	
  Therefore, I’d like to propose an idea for a piece of software that isn’t too complex. It’s quite feasible, given that we have a couple of bright minds to accomplish the task. Because this project is not necessarily the most difficult, though, it might be interesting to add elements that a typical address book might not have, such as social media usernames, nicknames, and maiden names. The name of this “invention” is “RoloTech.”
  
*This project requires 2 people if the added elements are to be included*
